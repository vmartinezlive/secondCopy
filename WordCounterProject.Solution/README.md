# WordCounter

#### Application where it counts how frequent the word is used in a sentence

#### By **Victoria Martinez**

## Description

Program that gathers both a word and sentence from a user, then checks how frequently the word appears in the sentence. It should check for full word matches only. (For instance, if provided the word "cat" and sentence "I'm walking to the cathedral." the first three letters of the word cathedral would not be counted.)

Build out an MVC web user interface for the Word Counter application you built in last week's independent project. You should clone your repo from last week and use the same git log.

## Objectives
###C# Basic and Testing
* Create specs in plain english with on README
* Specs include specific input and output values and a descriptive sentence.
* Specs begin with the simplest possible behavior and progress to more complex cases, covering different input values.
* All specs are translated correctly as test methods.
* All tests are passing, and described functionality is present.

* Identify words in a word
  Input:  Apple
  Output: Apple
* Identify words in a sentence
  Input:  I see a cat
  Output: I see a cat
* Identify similar words in a sentence
  Input:  Fire! Fire! Where's the Fire?

  Output: "Fire!" "Fire!" "Where's" "the" "Fire?"
* Count the number of words in sentence
  Input:  Fire! Fire! Where's the Fire?
  Output: 3
